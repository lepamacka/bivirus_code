This git contains MATLAB code representing the four-step method of generating a bi-virus system with two stable survival of the fittest equilibria, as described in the paper "Constructing competing epidemic networks with multiple survival of the fittest outcomes" by Mengbin Ye et al. 
The main file is the script called doubly_stable_generator.m. It uses the function file called doubly_stable_func.m.

The script takes an input spread matrix A and generates another spread matrix B. Together, A and B define a bivirus
system with corresponding survival of the fittest equilibria x and y, such that both of these equilibria will be stable.
